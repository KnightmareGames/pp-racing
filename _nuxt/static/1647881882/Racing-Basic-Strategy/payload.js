Most people may play it casually, simply upgrading their Stats, picking whatever they like best whether that's Top Speed or Acceleration, Handling or Durability, or even just overall total points. None of these ways is wrong. The best way to play PP Racing is to do whatever you find the most enjoyable with the time you have. This blog post, however, is for those people who like the min max experience. People who enjoy the mechanics of games and pushing themselves to the limit. The People who want to have the biggest fastest PP on the block, on any track, in any scenario. It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or you've been playing for a while today we're here to help you make the most of the PP you've got.

But at the core, they all have the same foundation. You select the Pod you'd like to enter into the race, (for all actions besides Trials this will be a Pod you own from your Garage) then you either select or are told the type of Race Track you'll be racing on, and then you race! Because PP Racing is a simulation game, the whole race is run automatically and you receive the results instantly. Because of this, knowing what type of Race Tracks and Actions your Pod excels at are the best way to guarantee that you'll have the most favorable outcome possible! There are three things that actually affect how well your PP will perform during any race: The Track, your Stats, and your CHIPPs.
