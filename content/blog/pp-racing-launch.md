# Planetary Pod Racing is ready to play!

Thank you to everyone who participated in our alpha testing of PP Racing, without you the game wouldn't be what it is today.
That being said, you'll notice some huge differences in gameplay from before. We are really excited with our currently gameplay loop, but if you have any comments, questions or concerns. Reach out to use in the [PP Racing Official Server](https://discord.gg/9VJbcpNbyv).
<br>
<br>

**Getting started for racers**
<br>

The bot should guide you through everything you need to know about PP Racing, but in case it doesn't I'll give you a quick breakdown on how to get started.
<br>
<br>

- `/register` to get your first pod
<br>

- `/scavenge` for some loot, `/skirmish` for some money,  `/duel` other players, or `/trial` if all your pods get destroyed.
<br>

- `/refuel` when you run out of fuel, you can travel to other planets (Discord Servers) and use their fueling stations to get even more
<br>

- `/shop` to spend that hard earned QUID
<br>

- `/garage` to check your stats and equip new pods
<br>

- `/claim daily`. DON'T FORGET THIS, maintain your streak.
<br>
<br>

**Getting started for planets**
<br>

The bot should also guide you, but a little less. Here is what you need to know:
<br>
<br>

- `/planet` create YOUR_PLANET_NAME ... good luck, this is your new home.
<br>

- `/planet` shop to create a new shop for your players that automatically rotates new items for sale
<br>

- `/planet` fuel_depot to create a fuel depot for players to claim fuel at
<br>
<br>

This is just the beginning. We will be adding more shops, allowing for more customization and upgrades as the game progresses.
If you have ideas on what you would want to have on your planet, [let us know](https://discord.gg/9VJbcpNbyv)
<br>
<br>

Thank you so much for your continued support. Keep an eye out for more news and updates soon.
Always remember to #playwithyourpp
